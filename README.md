# Constructors-and-Destructors
How do we initialize the attributes in a class with overloading functions.


## Constructors

Initially the attributes assigned under private inside a class are normally initialized to Garbage values. What if you want to initialize them in to some values. Then we have to use Constructors.   

Constructors are a special kind of function inside a class.   
Constructors have no return type (not even void)  
Conctructor has the same name as the class
